Let me summarise this long story for you -

1. Programming language doesn’t make you a better developer; building a solid foundation of software engineering principles does. So, don’t go on searching for the best programming language.
2. Choose a language that has good online support.
3. Choose a language that is not scary and easy to write code in. 
4. My personal preference is `python`. Although, javascript is also a good option.

Since you have come so far, I know that you have the patience and the interest
to read the entire story. I tried my best to shorten the story, but the I needed
to convince you of a very important step - choosing your first programming
language.

People who want to start writing code, or students who want to build their
career as software developers often think which programming language they should
start with. 

* Some want to choose the best programming language. 
* Some want a language that is famous in the industry and can help them get good jobs.
* Some want to learn the newest language in the market. It must be better than the old ones.
* Some go after building apps, and think they will learn the language on the way.

> Programming language is a tool. It doesn’t make you a better developer, and
> will not give you better credibility.

So….. which language should you start with ???

That depends on what you want to achieve after learning the language.

Yes. It’s as simple as that.

* If you want to build an Android app learn Kotlin or Java.
* If you want to build an iOS app learn Swift.
* If you want to build beautiful web pages learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* If you are a student and want good grades in your language course, learn whatever the professor is teaching you.

BUT … if you want to build a good career as a software engineer …

DO NOT go after searching for the best programming languages, learn how to build
logical solutions to a problem.

What do I mean by that?

Programming languages are just tools that help humans ask computers to do stuff
for them. Each programming language just makes it easier to do a certain kind of
job or in some cases it is the only tool we can choose.

For example, the browser(Chrome, Firefox etc.) understands only HTML, CSS and
Javascript. You can’t write a program in C++ or Java that has to be executed on
the browser. An Android application needs to be written in Kotlin or Java only.

Software developers are paid to build solutions to problems. To build efficient
and stable solutions, one would eventually have to work on multiple languages.

> The real deal lies in using the best tool to solve the problem at hand.

Tools(language or frameworks) that you will use to build a chat application(like WhatsApp) will be completely different from the tools to be used to build a photo sharing site like Instagram.

Every programming language(or framework) has its strengths and weaknesses. They must be chosen based on the end result needed.

_The real question is - What knowledge should I have to easily switch between
multiple languages or frameworks._

Every language has more or less similar constructs and tools to get things done. Some common constructs are -

1. Variables
2. Arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc.
3. Conditional statements - If a condition is true perform some action.
4. Looping constructs - Repeat a task certain number of times.
5. Object Oriented Programming - A certain pattern of writing code
6. Functional Programming - Another pattern of writing code
7. Error handling
8. etc.

Understand these basics. Learn where and how to use them. If you are comfortable
using these patterns in one language, you can use them in other languages also.

> Learn one language first. Learn it well. Be very comfortable in that language.

Coming to the million dollar question of What Should My First Programming Language?

Your first programming language show should be -

1. Should be simple to write in, so that you can concentrate on the solution rather than the language syntax.
2. Should be easier to find help on the internet. Common problems have been addressed in online forums like StackOverflow etc.
3. Should have an ecosystem of stable libraries for common tasks like building web services, parsing files of common formats(json etc.).
4. Better if it is popular in the software industry. Eg. a language called ‘Javascript’ is very famous, but a language like ‘Lisp’ is not so famous. Working on an industry famous language adds weight to your resume.
5. Since, it is very common for developers to work on web services. Your first language should have a good support building web applications.

**I would recommend to choose amongst following two languages that satisfy the
above criteria -**

1. **Python** <img width=200 src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prd-hc-oj-public-1/public/users/73794b05-fe63-4188-81cd-b6fd35c7aa4e/images/8r2wVkA4W3qIUR4FGDe3Tr5dZI97zbrw">
2. **Javascript** <img width=80 src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prd-hc-oj-public-1/public/users/73794b05-fe63-4188-81cd-b6fd35c7aa4e/images/szKckFUtCsH2kWNTHSIQkJJQXVDPxTyA">

Why?

1. Both are pretty easy to learn and write code in. 
2. Both have very good online support i.e. you can find answers to almost all the problems you will face while working in them.
3. Both have a stable ecosystem of libraries. This is very important for any language.

> Python and Javascript both do not scare beginner developers.
